# Cinnamon-Cinema-Movie-Theatre

#Initial Approach:
1. There is one database that stored "Movies", "Seats", "Users"
2. "BookingManager" class, Handles the User's requests.

### We have two kinds of Seats:
1. Gold seat: User can choose Any Available seats.
2. Silver Seats: Automatically assigned first available seats (maximum of 3 seats).
