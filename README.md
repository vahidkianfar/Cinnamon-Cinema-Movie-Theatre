# Cinnamon-Cinema-Movie-Theatre

#Initial Approach:
1. There is one database that stored "Movies", "Seats", "Users"
2. "BookingManager" class, Handles the User's requests.
3. Everytime that you start the program, All seatStatuses on the database reset to Free.

### We have two kinds of Seats:
1. Gold seat: User can choose Any Available seats.
2. Silver Seats (for the KATA) : Automatically assigned first available seats (maximum of 3 seats).
